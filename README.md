# FoodSense

According to eastern medicine and culture, every person has a unique body constitution which is an indicator of what type of diet they should have. Some foods may aggravate symptoms (i.e. headaches, bloatedness, rashes) for certain body types indicating a food sensitivity. Other research shows that heart rate (HR) can be used as a biomarker for health. 

FoodSense is for anyone who wants to maintain or improve their overall health through diet. Our application focuses on gathering information and providing a personalized diet to its users based on the principles of the body constitutions, specifically the Eight-Constitution Medicine, using HR as a biomarker. The Eight-Constitution recommends a diet for people to follow for their current body constitution; negative or positive effects on HR levels from food intake could help categorize a user into a specific body constitution. The application will continuously measure the user’s HR levels and recalibrate the user’s body constitution to help maintain or improve HR levels

### How it works

Food Journal
```
Provides user with history of foods they ate along with classifying whether the food was good, neutral, or bad. 
```

Heart Rate

```
Give the example
```

Health State

```
Displays a graph of the user's heart rate over a specified duration and displays a graph of their heart rate change over that same duration. Along with telling the user their current body constitution and giving them a list of food recommendations.
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
